            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <!-- detailed intro -->
            <p>Being a queer person myself, it's very important to me that knowledge about queer identities and queer issues be spread throughout the general populus. I, myself, am transgender, gender fluid, non-binary, and pansexual. These identities alone may require some explaining for the average non-queer person to understand or even for some queer people to understand. That's where I come in. I'm able to explain the different nomenclature and naming conventions of queer identities and the queer community, as well as the interpersonal relations within the community and all the complexities therein.</p>

            <p>Be sure to check out some of my social media to get a better feel for who I am as a person:</p>

            <h2>Current Projects</h2>

            <p>I'm currently in the process of making a series of introductory BDSM education videos, which you can find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhCLFcWzlUA&list=PLgvUWGX_9S-Ze6wOvl2DNaUTpDLkQNRUv" target="_blank">here</a> </p>

            <p>I'm also making a series of conversational BDSM education videos, with a podcast style. You can find that series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EExwIK8-54o&list=PLgvUWGX_9S-ae0cQMwFKw8Uu3sDwy3LZf" target="_blank">here</a> </p>

            <p>Additionally, I have a series of videos showcasing a different in-depth queer issue with each new video. That series can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYmwIZUDalA&list=PLgvUWGX_9S-Z0PDCKGR8ruD5znxgecWG2" target="_blank">here</a> </p>

            <h2>My Services</h2>
            <p>I offer a number of services through booking.</p>

            <p>A <b>speaking</b> would most likely consist of a presentation of different queer issues and topics, as well as the definitions and meanings therein.</p>

            <p>Whereas a <b>Q&A</b> would consist of a self introduction and a group asking any and all questions they may have about queer identities and the queer community, which I would then of course answer to the best of my ability.</p>

            <p>Additionally, a <b>video conference</b> could consist of either a speaking or a Q&A over video chat, if I'm not able to physically travel to your location for one reason or another.</p>

            <p>Be sure to specify which service you would like when contacting me for booking!</p>
